## GKE overview
> Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) provides a managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling your containerized applications using Google infrastructure. The GKE environment consists of multiple machines (specifically, Compute Engine instances) grouped together to form a cluster.

## Modes of operation
> The level of flexibility, responsibility, and control that you require for your clusters determines the mode of operation to use in GKE. GKE clusters have two modes of operation to choose from:

* **`Autopilot:`** Manages the entire cluster and node infrastructure for you. Autopilot provides a hands-off Kubernetes experience so that you can focus on your workloads and only pay for the resources required to run your applications. Autopilot clusters are pre-configured with an optimized cluster configuration that is ready for production workloads.

* **`Standard:`** Provides you with node configuration flexibility and full control over managing your clusters and node infrastructure. For clusters created using the Standard mode, you determine the configurations needed for your production workloads, and you pay for the nodes that you use.
